WebApp Framework
================

This framework is the product of much research and frustration.  Existing
boilerplates freely modify Backbone core, lack a build process, and are very
prescriptive; WebApp Framework changes that.

Organize your application with a logical file structure, develop your
Models/Collections/Views/Routers inside modules, and build knowing you have
efficient code that will not bottleneck your users.

## Getting started ##

The easiest way to get started is to install Git and clone the repository:

``` bash
# Create a new project directory and enter it.
mkdir myproject && cd myproject

# Using Git, fetch only the last few commits.  You don't need the full history
# for your project.
git clone --q --depth 0 git@github.com:webapp/framework.git .
```
